# Internship-DIscord-Monitor

The objective of this Internship Discord Monitor is to notify and inform people (mainly students) about internship opportunities that get posted in the readne of https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships. 
It's a discord bot coded in python that checks the readme every 10 minutes to see if there were any new additions, and if there are, it sends a webhook to a discord channel with the information posted. 

Bot is currently ineffective due to big changes in the readme.
